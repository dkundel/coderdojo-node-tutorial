# Learning Node.JS

This is a series of sessions at a CoderDojo where we are teaching the kids and teens how to write programs in JavaScript using Node.JS. The sessions last around two hours and these files are the post-session write-ups to help to catch up with missed sessions or repeat the sessions within the 2 week break between each session.

If you have any questions you can always ping me via Twitter. Just tweet to [@dkundel](http://twitter.com/dkundel).
